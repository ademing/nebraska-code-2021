## Informational Only (Not Part of Presentation)

### **Title**

"What type of superhero do you want on your dev team?" |

### **Abstract**

"After you've worked in Software Engineering for some time, you start to recognize different types of developers: The planner who second guesses every method name, the gold plater who won't stop fixing edge cases, and the speedy dev who wants to win the race that no one else is a part of, just to name a few. A similar statement can also be said for some of the more popular superheroes in comics, TV, and movies. And just like those superheroes, developers have strengths (superpowers), areas they struggle (weaknesses), and often work in teams.

As a developer who has lead many different teams, and who has an encyclopedic knowledge of superheroes in pop culture, I believe there are a lot of shared principles that we can utilize to make the highest functioning teams. This first comes from classifying developers into archetypes (don't worry, I understand developers don't fall in a single category) and then figuring out how to distribute them amongst teams. These teams should not be full of individuals with the same powers because the weaknesses will be obvious to the villains (bugs, new features, and any other projects that need to be "vanquished")." |

## Introduction

### Why am I qualified for this talk?

- [ ] Should I call this "My History with Buildertrend" or something like that?

- Manager, Trainer, Team Lead as BT grew from 20 -> 70 devs
  - [ ] Gif of team from Nicholas st
  - [ ] Gif of bigger dev group
  - [ ] Get accurate numbers of engineers
- Watched Spider-man, Superman, Batman
  - [ ] Can I find the old Batman costume picture?
- Comic reader
  - [ ] Picture from college where I'm reading comics?
- Overall Nerd Dad
  - [ ] Picture of Sloan, and I, with stormtroopers

### What we've been through at Buildertrend

- [ ] Does it make sense to cover the mistakes at Buildertrend
  - Teams too large
  - Strong devs becoming team leads
  - Too junior

### What won't be covered?

- Why Marvel is better than DC
- Why Superman sucks
- ~~Where do Villains fall into this~~
- How people are more complex than this. We're simplifying to help form strong teams.

### How can we use Superheroes to form strong teams?

- Developers typically align with archetypes
- We can use the last 100 years of Superhero stories as a basis for good dev teams
- How we can work together to "save the day"

## The Heroes

### The Speedster

- Solve problems fast; Leave a trail of destruction in their wake
  - Kind of like consultants (Jesse's Idea)
- [ ] Can I use the gif from the CW of car windows shattering?

### The Master Detective

- Self-taught; abrasive; thinks they work best alone
- Has contingencies for the failure of teammates
  - ie. re-writes their code after they go to bed
- [ ] Find Batman image

### The Tool Man

- Someone who is constantly using the latest "and greatest" tool or library
  - We've called it technolust
- Need to coach them how to use the correct tool for a job
  - Take time to vet
  - Be prepared to stick with something legacy to balance out the business need
- [ ] Add gif of Instant kill mode

### The Eagle Scout

- Cap and Superman
- Follows the rules laid out "to a t"
- Code reviews expectations are higher for these individuals

- [ ] Is there a more gender diverse name for this slide?

### The "Experienced" Coach

- Cecil Stegman, Nick Fury, Amanda Waller
- Various methodologies to get people on track
  - Not always good... Suicide Squad
- Might not do the "hands on" work

---

## The Villains

### Who are the villains that the superheroes go up against?

- Maybe QA? The client? Other teams within org?
  - WRONG! It's not a group of people
  - Imagine the Civil Wars!
- As is the case with the most compelling villains in pop culture, our nemeses are typically our own making
  - Low-level criminals: Enhancements to existing features, day to day responsibilities of team
  - Recurring Supervillains: Bugs, refactors/code health,
  - Arch-nemesis: New features that don't work well with current functionality

### How did we create difficult to enhance code

- Neglecting code health
- Sacrificing automated testing
- Writing code without first building a solid foundation or plan
- Requirements shifting significantly during development cycles

---

## How do we use this to form teams?

### Teammates, roommates, and classmates

- X-Men
- Similar backgrounds
- Solve problems together even if they pull all nighters
- Team lead is dull and busy with in-fighting

### Team of Gods

- Justice League
- Individually already unbeatable
- Not answering to any higher power

### The "Ideal" Team (from a nerdy development manager's perspective?)

- [ ] Better name for the category?
- Team comes together when problems need to be solved
- Leaders are rotating
- Junior members are raised to be the leaders
  - Ex. Rogue, Kitty Pryde (for X-men though), Sam Wilson
- Various teams to focus on different initiatives
  - Teams within teams?
  - Ex Mighty Avengers, Secret Avengers, New Avengers, Uncanny Avengers
- Contain individuals previously mentioned.
